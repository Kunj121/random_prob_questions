    "question": "You flip a fair coin 4 times. You earn $2 for each head and lose $1 for each tail. What is your expected payout?",
    "answer": "E[payout] = 4 × (0.5×2 + 0.5×(−1)) = 4 × 0.5 = $2."

    "answer": "E = (12/52)×10 + (4/52)×5 + (36/52)×0 = 140/52 ≈ $2.69."

    "answer": "P(win) = 10/100 = 0.1 → E[winnings] = 0.1×40 = $4 → Net = 4 − 5 = −$1."
