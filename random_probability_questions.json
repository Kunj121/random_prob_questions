    "question": "Three boxes are labeled incorrectly: (1) Apples, (2) Oranges, and (3) Apples+Oranges. One box has only apples, one only oranges, and one a mix. By drawing a single piece of fruit from one box, how can you correctly relabel all the boxes?",
    "answer": "Draw from the box labeled “Apples+Oranges.” Because the label is wrong, that box must actually have either all apples or all oranges. Use that single draw to infer the true contents and fix all labels."

    "answer": "After the first gold, the probability is 2/3. After drawing gold again (with replacement), it becomes [ (2/3)*1 ] / [ (2/3)*1 + (1/3)*(1/2 ) ] = 4/5."
